                <h2>Explore your pantry with recipes curated to perfection.</h2>
                <p>At Zest, we believe taste trumps all. Whether you're a beginner — new to the kitchen and all its appliances &#38; tools — or a seasoned chef with a fascination for the simple pleasures, Zest is your go-to one-stop-shop for all things essential. We believe that you don't have to hop on a plane to explore all corners of the earth. Your expedition begins right in your pantry: spices the Middle East, fresh feta cheese from the Mediterranean, or even a solid hot dog to celebrate an American past-time. </p>
                <br></br>
                <p>Our curated recipes are chosen by a select council of tastemakers with their pulse on varying cuisine trends. Save yourself the rabbit hole of the internet and the frustrations &#38; tears that come with preparing a meal from scratch. Allow those who've studied not only the culinary arts, but the cultures these dishes come from to guide you through a tour of your tastebuds without ever having to leave your hometown. Instructions are written with you in mind: easy to follow, straightforward, with no special chef-skills needed. Authentic, easy, and most importantly--delicious. </p>
